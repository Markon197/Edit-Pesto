# Changelog

Every shipped change bumps `APP_VERSION` in [lib/version.ts](lib/version.ts) (shown in the masthead) and gets a line here, so it's obvious at a glance whether the live site reflects the latest request.

## Version 3 — 2026-08-05
- Dark mode shows a small italic "Nut Free" label next to the logo (pesto usually has pine nuts) — a dark-mode-only easter egg.
- Stronger contrast on the accepted-edit (green/bold) highlight color in both themes, so it reads more clearly against normal body text.

## Version 2 — 2026-08-05
- Added a small hover animation on the masthead logo (the leaf antenna perks up).
- Removed "InsuranceERM" and the "concept mockup" caveat from the tagline.
- Added a manual dark-mode toggle in the masthead (defaults to light, remembers your choice via localStorage, no flash on reload).

## Version 1 — 2026-08-05
- Editorial redesign: light paper background, serif typography (Georgia/Times New Roman), restrained hairline borders instead of card shadows/neon accents.
- Renamed the product to **PestoBot**; new robot logomark in the masthead (the browser-tab favicon is unchanged, by request).
- Added a small animation (steaming bowl) in the output pane while a check is running.
- Added the version number itself, shown next to the wordmark.
